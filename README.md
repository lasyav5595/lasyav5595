## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Lasya Venigalla, and I am a highly skilled GIS Specialist with a strong background in Remote Sensing. I hold a Ph.D. in Geospatial Information Sciences from The University of Texas at Dallas and a Master's in Geography from the University of Missouri, Columbia. I have completed numerous projects focused on object-based image classification, urban feature extraction, and deep learning techniques. 

I work as a GIS Analyst at Harris County Public Health, leveraging my expertise in GIS to support public health initiatives. My role involves analyzing spatial data to identify trends and patterns that inform decision-making and policy development. I collaborate closely with public health officials to create comprehensive maps and visualizations that effectively communicate complex data to various stakeholders.

I utilize advanced GIS tools and techniques, including Python programming, ESRI products, and ERDAS Image, to manage and analyze large datasets efficiently. My experience in remote sensing and deep learning allows me to apply innovative approaches to urban feature extraction and health data analysis, ultimately aiding in community health assessments and resource allocation.

Additionally, I contribute to data collection efforts by developing applications that streamline the gathering and processing of geospatial information. This enhances our ability to respond to community needs effectively, ensuring that our public health efforts are data-driven and responsive to emerging challenges. Through my work, I aim to make a meaningful impact on public health outcomes in Harris County.

Additionally, I have experience as an instructor and teaching assistant, effectively conveying complex GIS concepts to students.
